/* KnoxMap.exe - what KnoxMap.bat did, as something you can double-click.
 *
 * A batch file opens a console window, can be blocked by policy, and looks
 * like something you should not run. This does the same four things and
 * nothing else:
 *
 *   1. work in the folder it is in, wherever that is,
 *   2. PYTHONUTF8=1, so every file KnoxMap reads and writes is UTF-8 on a
 *      Windows whose code page cannot hold all of its text,
 *   3. run Setup.bat first, in a console of its own, if there is no
 *      environment yet - that is the long first run, and it has to be
 *      watchable,
 *   4. start .venv\Scripts\pythonw.exe knoxmap.py and exit straight away.
 *
 * Exiting straight away matters: an update replaces the files in this
 * folder, and Windows will not overwrite a running .exe.
 *
 * KnoxMap.bat is still there and still works, for anyone who would rather
 * read what they are running than trust a binary.
 *
 * Built by .github/workflows/release.yml with mingw-w64; it is not committed
 * as a binary.
