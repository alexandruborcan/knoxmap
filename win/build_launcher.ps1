# Build KnoxMap.exe with MSVC, the way Windows software is normally built.
#
#     win\build_launcher.ps1 [version]
#
# win/build_launcher.sh builds the same launcher with mingw-w64 and is what to
# use on Linux. This is what the release uses, for one reason: antivirus.
#
# The launcher is a small stripped binary whose whole job is two
# CreateProcessW calls, which is structurally what a dropper is, and mingw-w64
# output is heavily over-represented in the malware corpora the heuristics are
# trained on. Built with the toolchain the rest of Windows software uses, the
# same code stops looking like the thing it is not. None of this is a
# substitute for signing it - that is the only real fix - but it is free.
#
# Symbols are left in for the same reason: a tiny binary with everything
# stripped out of it reads as something with something to hide, and 30 KB is
# not worth it.
