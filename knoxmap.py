"""KnoxMap — the whole pipeline in one native window.

A real place becomes a playable Project Zomboid map:

    draw an area  ->  terrain  ->  buildings  ->  compile  ->  install

This is a thin shell. It starts the Flask app on a loopback port and shows it in
a native window (Edge WebView2 via pywebview), so the window gets the real
Leaflet map with the rectangle tool, place search and landmark lookup, rather
than a second UI that would drift from the web one.

Compiling uses the patched PZWorldEd_cli.exe that Setup installs (see
worlded/README.md); without it the app opens WorldEd on the project instead.

Run it with:  pythonw knoxmap.py      (or double-click KnoxMap.exe)
On Linux or macOS:  ./knoxmap.sh
