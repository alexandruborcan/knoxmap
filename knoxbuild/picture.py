"""A picture of a finished map, ready to show somebody.

tools/render_lots.py draws a compiled map the way the game draws it, but it
draws exactly the tiles you ask for at exactly the scale you ask for, and
getting something worth looking at out of it means knowing the map's size,
picking a window on it, choosing a scale that is neither a postage stamp nor
a 300-megapixel canvas, and then trimming the empty diagonal corners off the
result. That is what this does.

    from knoxbuild.picture import picture
    picture("output/mytown", "mytown.png")                  # the whole town
    picture("output/mytown", "inside.png", roofs=False)     # every room shown

An isometric view is a diamond, so the corners of the image are always empty;
they are cropped away, and what is left is centred on the project's own
background at the size asked for.
