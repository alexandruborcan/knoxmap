"""Buildings from Overture Maps, where OpenStreetMap has none.

OpenStreetMap is drawn by people, so how much of a town is on it depends on
who lives there and whether anyone has traced it. In a German town it is all
of it; in plenty of the world it is the high street and not much else, and a
map generated from it comes out as a few streets of buildings with empty land
where the rest of the town is.

Overture Maps publishes a buildings theme that is OpenStreetMap first and
machine-detected roofprints (Microsoft's and Google's) second, under the same
ODbL licence. Where OSM has the building, the two agree and this adds
nothing; where OSM is blank and somebody's model found a roof, it fills in.
Measured on two towns, the same size of box:

    Gifhorn, Germany   OSM 1,962 buildings   Overture adds    60  (3%)
    Urgup, Turkey      OSM   473 buildings   Overture adds   761 (62%)

The German ones are mostly sheds and garages, 38 m2 at the median. The
Turkish ones are houses, 87 m2 at the median, and they nearly treble the
town. So this is off by default and worth turning on exactly where a mapper
can see their town is half missing - which they can, from the preview.

`_houses_from_addresses` in the renderer already does a smaller version of
this from OSM's own address points, and keeps doing it: it catches the houses
somebody numbered but never drew. That was 22 houses in Gifhorn and 20 in
Urgup, so it is not an alternative to this, and the two do not collide -
addresses are filled in after, and only where nothing stands yet.

The data is GeoParquet on S3 and there is no HTTP API for a bounding box, so
this needs DuckDB, which is not a small install and is therefore optional.
Without it everything else works and the setting says why. One fetch of a
town takes two to three minutes, nearly all of it DuckDB reading the metadata
of every file in the theme to find the handful that cover the box, so the
answer is cached beside the map like the Overpass one.
