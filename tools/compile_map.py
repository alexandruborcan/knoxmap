"""Compile a Knoxify project to .lot files, a batch of cells at a time.

    python tools/compile_map.py output/mytown [--batch 4]

WorldEd's lot export never releases what it loads: every cell adds to the map
and tileset caches, so one process compiling a whole town climbs without limit.
A 572-cell map reached 13.7 GB and had done under a sixth of the work before the
machine started thrashing.

So the work is handed over in batches, each to a fresh PZWorldEd_cli process
which exits and gives the memory back. Output accumulates in the same lots
folder, because each batch only generates the cells it was given.
