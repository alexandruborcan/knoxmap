"""Write lang/english.txt: every line of the window, ready to be translated.

    python tools/make_lang_template.py

Anyone can put KnoxMap in their language without touching the code: copy
lang/english.txt to lang/<their language>.txt, translate the right-hand side
of each line, and pick the language at the top of the window. The name of the
file is the name in the menu, so russian.txt appears as "Russian".

The English side is what the window actually says, so this is generated rather
than typed: the text of every element in templates/index.html, its
placeholders and titles, and the messages static/js writes into the page. A
line whose translation is left as the English is simply not translated, which
is what an untouched template does.
